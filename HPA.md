# HPA
Hi I want to set HAP for nginx and I want to scal down and scale up nginx deployment with the size of a queue in rabbitmq,  i deployed a queue with name is ghaedi , so I deployed a prometheus and servicemonitor fore scrape rabbitmq on prometheus , please tell me how to create HPA and start promethues adapter for custom metric , i use rabbitmq_queue_messages{namespace="rabbitmq",queue="ghaedi"} for my query

To set up Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) for Nginx based on a custom metric from RabbitMQ, you will need to:

Ensure Prometheus Adapter is installed.
Configure Prometheus Adapter to expose custom metrics.
Create an HPA resource that uses the custom metric to scale Nginx based on RabbitMQ queue size.
Steps to Set Up HPA Based on RabbitMQ Queue Metric:
1. Install Prometheus Adapter
The Prometheus Adapter exposes custom metrics to the Kubernetes API server, so that HPA can use them to scale pods. If you haven't installed it yet, here's how to install Prometheus Adapter:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/prometheus-adapter/releases/download/v0.9.0/prometheus-adapter-operator.yaml
This YAML will install the Prometheus Adapter in your cluster.

Alternatively, you can deploy Prometheus Adapter using Helm:

bash
Copy code
helm install prometheus-adapter prometheus-community/prometheus-adapter --namespace monitoring
Once installed, make sure to check if the adapter is running correctly:

bash
Copy code
kubectl get pods -n monitoring
2. Configure Prometheus Adapter for Custom Metric
Now you need to configure Prometheus Adapter to expose the custom metric rabbitmq_queue_messages.

Create a custom metrics-config.yaml file for Prometheus Adapter.
yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: prometheus-adapter-config
  namespace: monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    rules:
      - seriesQuery: 'rabbitmq_queue_messages{namespace="rabbitmq",queue="ghaedi"}'
        resources:
          overrides:
            namespace:
              resource: "namespace"
            queue:
              resource: "queue"
        name:
          matches: "rabbitmq_queue_messages"
          as: "ghaedi_queue_messages"
        metricsQuery: 'rabbitmq_queue_messages{namespace="rabbitmq",queue="ghaedi"}'
This configuration will expose the metric ghaedi_queue_messages for the RabbitMQ queue ghaedi.

Apply the config:
bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f metrics-config.yaml
3. Create the HPA for Nginx Deployment
Now you can create the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for your Nginx deployment, using the custom metric ghaedi_queue_messages.

Here's an example of an HPA manifest:

yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: nginx-hpa
  namespace: default  # Replace with your Nginx namespace
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: nginx  # Replace with your Nginx deployment name
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
    - type: External
      external:
        metric:
          name: ghaedi_queue_messages
          selector:
            matchLabels:
              queue: "ghaedi"  # Ensure this matches your custom metric
        target:
          type: Value
          value: "1000"  # Set the target value for scaling
In this example:

We are setting a minReplicas of 1 and maxReplicas of 10.
We use the custom metric ghaedi_queue_messages to scale the Nginx pods.
The target value is set to 1000 (you can adjust this depending on your needs). This means if the queue size exceeds 1000 messages, Kubernetes will scale up the Nginx deployment.
Apply the HPA configuration:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f nginx-hpa.yaml
4. Verify the Setup
You can verify the scaling behavior and the custom metric by checking the HPA:

bash
Copy code
kubectl get hpa nginx-hpa -n default  # Replace with your Nginx namespace
This will show you the current number of replicas and how the HPA is scaling based on the custom metric.

You can also query the custom metric to check if Prometheus Adapter is exposing it correctly:

bash
Copy code
kubectl get --raw "/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/namespaces/default/ghaedi_queue_messages"
Notes:
Ensure that Prometheus is scraping metrics correctly from RabbitMQ, as the metrics need to be available for the Prometheus Adapter to work.
Adjust the scaling target value (value: "1000") according to the size of the queue and your scaling requirements.
Ensure that the namespace and labels match the Prometheus query you're using.
By following these steps, you can set up HPA for your Nginx deployment based on the size of the RabbitMQ queue ghaedi.

i get the error error: resource mapping not found for name: "nginx-hpa" namespace: "hpa" from "nginx-hpa": no matches for kind "HorizontalPodAutoscaler" in version "autoscaling/v2beta2"
ensure CRDs are installed first

The error message you are receiving indicates that the Kubernetes cluster cannot find the HorizontalPodAutoscaler resource in the version autoscaling/v2beta2. This usually happens when the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) CRD (Custom Resource Definition) is not installed or the API version you're using is incompatible with the version of your Kubernetes cluster.

Steps to Fix the Error:
Check the Kubernetes Version
First, check your Kubernetes version to ensure that the autoscaling/v2beta2 API version is supported. You can check your Kubernetes version with the following command:

bash
Copy code
kubectl version --short
If you're using Kubernetes 1.23+, the autoscaling/v2beta2 API should be available, but if you're using an older version, you'll need to use a different API version (e.g., autoscaling/v2).
For Kubernetes 1.22 or older:
Use the autoscaling/v2 API version for HPA, as v2beta2 might not be supported:

yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: nginx-hpa
  namespace: default  # Replace with your Nginx namespace
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: nginx  # Replace with your Nginx deployment name
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
    - type: External
      external:
        metric:
          name: ghaedi_queue_messages
          selector:
            matchLabels:
              queue: "ghaedi"  # Ensure this matches your custom metric
        target:
          type: Value
          value: "1000"  # Set the target value for scaling
This will work for Kubernetes versions 1.22 and below.

For Kubernetes 1.23 or higher:
The autoscaling/v2beta2 API version should be available by default, but if the HPA CRD is not found, it's possible that the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler CRD is not installed in your cluster.

Ensure HPA CRDs Are Installed
You can install the necessary HPA CRDs (for autoscaling) with the following commands:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/cluster/addons/metrics-server/hpa-autoscaler.yaml
Alternatively, you can apply the CRDs from the metrics-server repository:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes/metrics-server/releases/download/v0.5.0/metrics-server-components.yaml
This will ensure the CRDs required for scaling resources are installed and available.

Reapply the HPA Configuration
After installing the CRDs and confirming the Kubernetes version, you can proceed to apply the HorizontalPodAutoscaler configuration.

If you're using Kubernetes 1.22 or below, apply the autoscaling/v2 version.
For Kubernetes 1.23 or higher, apply the autoscaling/v2beta2 version.
Use this command to apply the HPA:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f nginx-hpa.yaml
Confirming the Fix:
After applying the HPA configuration, you can verify that the HPA has been created by running:
bash
Copy code
kubectl get hpa nginx-hpa -n default  # Replace 'default' with your Nginx namespace if needed
You can check if your HPA is working and scaling by monitoring the replicas with:
bash
Copy code
kubectl get deploy nginx -n default  # Replace 'default' with your Nginx namespace
If all goes well, the HPA should scale the Nginx deployment based on the custom metric (ghaedi_queue_messages from RabbitMQ).

Let me know if this resolves the issue or if you encounter any further problems!
